# FacialRecognitionProject
My submission for Kaggle Mini Competition, where I create a convoluted neural network to implement and train a Facial Recognition Model

The Neural Network was created with four Convolutional Layers and Two Fully Connected Layers.

After training, the model was able to obtain a kaggle score of .77982

My username for kaggle can be one of two things, 
- I log in with my email: ebruhns@cpp.edu
- The name displayed on the Leaderboard is my full name: "Eric Bruhns"
